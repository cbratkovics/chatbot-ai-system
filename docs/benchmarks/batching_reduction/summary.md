- **Near-optimal (6-7 requests)**: 18% of batches
- **Timeout-triggered (<6)**: 4% of batches

### Conclusions

1. **Dramatic API Call Reduction**: 87.5% fewer API calls significantly reduces rate limiting risk
2. **Improved Throughput**: 3.56x increase in processing capacity
3. **Better Resource Utilization**: Lower CPU, memory, and network usage
4. **Enhanced Reliability**: Zero failures with batching vs 0.3% failure rate without
5. **Substantial Cost Savings**: ~$90K annual savings at projected volume

### Recommendations

1. **Dynamic Batch Sizing**: Adjust batch size based on current load
2. **Priority Queuing**: Implement priority lanes for time-sensitive requests
3. **Adaptive Timeouts**: Reduce wait windows during low-traffic periods
4. **Monitoring**: Track batch efficiency metrics in production
5. **Failover Strategy**: Maintain sequential processing as fallback

### Implementation Benefits
- Reduces infrastructure costs
- Improves system scalability
- Decreases API rate limit pressure
