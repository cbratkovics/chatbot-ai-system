# 📊 Branch Comparison: Main vs Demo

## Overview
This repository maintains two primary branches for different use cases:

| Aspect | `main` Branch | `demo` Branch |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Purpose** | Full enterprise system | Streamlined demo |
| **Target Audience** | Enterprise deployments | Developers trying the system |
| **Setup Time** | 30+ minutes | < 5 minutes |
| **Complexity** | High | Low |
| **Files** | 258 files | ~150 files |
| **Dependencies** | 100+ packages | 35 packages |

## 🌳 Branch Structure

```
main (default)
├── Full enterprise features
├── Complete test suites
├── Kubernetes configurations
├── FinOps dashboards
├── Benchmarking tools
├── CI/CD pipelines
└── Terraform infrastructure

demo
├── Simplified configuration
├── One-command setup
├── Essential features only
├── Optimized Docker setup
├── Clear documentation
└── Quick deployment scripts
```

## 🔄 Switching Between Branches

### Using the Script
```bash
./scripts/utils/switch_version.sh
```

### Manual Switching
```bash
# Switch to main (full system)
git checkout main

# Switch to demo (streamlined)
git checkout demo

# See differences
git diff main..demo --stat
```

## 📦 Version Tags

### Demo Releases
- `v1.0.0-demo` - Initial demo release
- `v1.1.0-demo` - (planned) Add UI improvements
- `v1.2.0-demo` - (planned) Add more providers

### Main Releases
- `v1.0.0` - Full system release
- `v2.0.0` - (planned) Enterprise features

## 🚀 When to Use Each Branch

### Use `main` Branch When:
- Deploying to production
- Need full enterprise features
- Require extensive testing
- Building custom integrations
- Contributing new features
- Need Kubernetes deployment
- Require FinOps tracking

### Use `demo` Branch When:
- Showcasing to stakeholders
- Quick proof of concept
- Developer evaluation
- Conference demos
- Tutorial creation
- Blog post examples
- Quick testing

## 🔧 Maintaining Both Branches

### Cherry-Picking Improvements
```bash
# Apply a specific commit from demo to main
git checkout main
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# Apply a fix from main to demo
git checkout demo
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

### Keeping Demo Updated
```bash
# Merge selective changes from main
git checkout demo
git merge main --no-ff --no-commit
# Then selectively stage changes
git add <files-to-include>
git commit -m "feat: Sync selected features from main"
```
